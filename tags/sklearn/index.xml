      <description>This Project contains all data and different analytic approaches that can be used to look at a problem. The Project was to create a dashboard, PowerPoint, Blog post, infographic, and finally tie it together with a video presentation. This was my first interaction with a blog and an infographic; both were very informative in understanding how to publicize a project. The data was pulled from the Nation Highway and Safety Board as well as the FAA.</description>

      <description>This project aims to predict police shootings in the United States. Police shootings are a hot button topic in the United States as their frequency increases year over year. By examining data provided by the FBI, the project team will provide insights into factors contributing to these shootings that may aid in reducing their numbers.
The project&amp;rsquo;s main goal was to determine if the fatal shooting could be predicted based on race, age, or signs of mental illness.</description>
