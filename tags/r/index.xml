      <description>The National Football League, or NFL for short, is a multi-billion dollar industry. The sport has followers worldwide, and the season spans almost the entire year when you dig into each of the different events. One of the largest events outside the Superbowl is the NFL draft. Preparing for the NFL Draft is another event called the NFL scouting combine. This event brings the top 300 or so collegiate players in the nation to Indianapolis, Indiana, for what is essentially a 4-day job interview.</description>

      <description>When a person is looking to build their idea or business, one place they can turn is Kickstarter.com. This site allows for one to open a campaign to search for investors to back their idea. The Kickstarter site explains that the beginning stage of a campaign is the busiest time, and you can expect the first few days to be jam-packed as you will need to spread the word on your campaign, answer questions from potential backers and rally all your social media networks in order to reach your fundraising goal.</description>

      <description>Travel is a billion-dollar industry, and the hotel or lodging sector takes a large portion of the revenue. Airbnb has quickly become a staple in the travel sector. With their bookable locations in just about every travel destination worldwide, you can easily see why they have become so successful. This project looks to finding ways a customer can locate the best host to book based on location and affordability. One of the main goals was to determine if a plugin or application could be created to help make future Airbnb bookings.</description>

      <description>This project aims to predict police shootings in the United States. Police shootings are a hot button topic in the United States as their frequency increases year over year. By examining data provided by the FBI, the project team will provide insights into factors contributing to these shootings that may aid in reducing their numbers.
The project&amp;rsquo;s main goal was to determine if the fatal shooting could be predicted based on race, age, or signs of mental illness.</description>

      <description>This project expanded on project 4 to look at how a superhero might be selected for a movie or television series based on their history and powers information. The use of Natural Language Processing for text mining was attempted to make the predictions. The data was retrieved from Kaggle and analyzed a superheroâ€™s overall score from their different abilities, and compared the results to the history text and powers text variables within the dataset.</description>

      <description>When looking for places to apply to college, a bit of research is required more often than not. However, more often than not, family or political ties could add to a decision-making process.

There are many national and international ranking systems out; however, does it truly matter where you go to school?</description>
