      <description>This Project contains all data and different analytic approaches that can be used to look at a problem. The Project was to create a dashboard, PowerPoint, Blog post, infographic, and finally tie it together with a video presentation. This was my first interaction with a blog and an infographic; both were very informative in understanding how to publicize a project. The data was pulled from the Nation Highway and Safety Board as well as the FAA.</description>
